# HPC_Benchmarks
## Accessing the HPC systems using HPC benchmarks - Stream Benchmark and HPL (Linpack)

The report details out the steps taken in the following:
1. Log in the given HPC system remote servers (management severs and client servers) from Windows with given IP, private ssh key and username for ssh-ing

2. Set up user with password-less access between all servers

3. NFS export of a directory and it's mounting

4. Setup and installation of MPI library across the nodes

5. Check the memory bandwidth on the systems using STREAM benchmark. (https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/)

6. Report the CPU floating point performance on all the systems, using the HPL (Linpack) benchmark

7. Setup SLURM scheduler and report total system performance
